# Events

Events are the core of the timeline, as they represent the main (and initial) source of information about each piece of history.

Each event consists of three parts

* The body, which consists of a blurb about each event (I.E Apple launches the Macintosh).
* The date of the event (I.E January 24, 1984)
* The location of the event (I.E Cupertino, U.S)

Each event when clicked on will link to a EventInFocus

#### The Code for an event
    function Event(props) {
      return (
        <div className="Event">
          <div className="Event-Container">
            <a href={props.href} id={props.id} className="Event-container-link">
              <figure className="Event-figure">
                <img className="Event-image" src={props.image} alt="Error" />
              </figure>
              <div className="Event-body">
                <span className="Event-date">{props.date}</span>
                <span className="Event-location">{props.location}.</span>
                <h3 className="Event-title">{props.title}</h3>
              </div>
            </a>
          </div>
        </div>
      );
    }
